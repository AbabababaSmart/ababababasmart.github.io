Hello and welcome to my personal webpage. I am currently an undergraduate student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in my senior year. Over the past two years, I have received research training at the NCC Lab (Neural Control and Computing Lab) under the supervision of [Prof. Quan Ying Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UpP9hJ8AAAAJ&hl=en), with my primary focus on AI for neuroscience. At present, I am taking a gap year and seeking a research internship that is both intellectually stimulating and provides opportunities for further learning.
